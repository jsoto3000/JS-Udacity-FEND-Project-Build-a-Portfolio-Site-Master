# Project Overview

For this project, we built a portfolio website. Udacity provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and we replicated that design in HTML and CSS. Also we developed a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects completed through the course of our Nanodegree programs.

## Why this project?

The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which school you attended or what your GPA was; they want to see what you’ve built! You need a professional portfolio to show off your skills.

## What I learned?

We learned how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and started to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. We learned how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.

## Why is this important to my career?

Having a comprehensive body of work (even those in-progress) in our portfolio will allow us to showcase and demonstrate the skills acquired.
